Geographic variation in social media metrics: An analysis
of Latin American journal articles

Simon Fraser University & Stanford University
Abstract
Purpose: This study aims to contribute to the understanding of how the potential of
altmetrics varies around the world by measuring the percentage of articles with non-zero
metrics (coverage) for articles published from a developing region (Latin America).
Design/methodology/approach: This study uses article metadata from a prominent Latin
American journal portal, SciELO, and combines it with altmetrics data from
Altmetric.com and with data collected by author-written scripts. The study is primarily
descriptive, focusing on coverage levels disaggregated by year, country, subject area, and
language.
Findings: Coverage levels for most of the social media sources studied was zero or
negligible. Only three metrics had coverage levels above 2%—Mendeley, Twitter, and
Facebook. Of these, Twitter showed the most significant differences with previous
studies. Mendeley coverage levels reach those found by previous studies, but it takes up
to two years longer for articles to be saved in the reference manager. For the most recent
year, coverage was less than half than what was found in previous studies. The coverage
levels of Facebook appear similar (around 3%) to that of previous studies.
Research limitations/implications: The Altmetric.com data used for some of the
analyses was collected for a six month period. For other analyses, Altmetric.com data
was only available for a single country (Brazil).
Originality/value: The results of this study have implications for the altmetrics research
community and for any stakeholders interested in using altmetrics for evaluation. It
suggests the need of careful sample selection when wishing to make generalizable claims
about altmetrics.

Introduction
Altmetrics hold the potential to change how research is discovered,
disseminated, evaluated, rewarded, and even read. They could become a
transformative force in academia, but only if they are shown to actually
provide “indications of impacts on diverse audiences including scholars
but also practitioners, clinicians, educators and the general public”
(Piwowar 2013, p.9) and to present the opportunity to measure and track
additional aspects of impact—aspects ignored by traditional bibliometric
approaches. However, to date, altmetrics remain largely understudied and
often misunderstood.
The perceived potential of altmetrics, coupled with this lack of
understanding of the behaviours that give rise to the metrics, has turned
altmetrics into a growing field of scholarly inquiry. In the process, several
definitions have emerged that propose, in varying levels of detail, that
altmetrics are essentially about examining the social Web as an alternative
or enhancement to traditional bibliometrics (Galligan and Dyas-Correia,
2013). Unfortunately, this reliance on the social Web means that any
relationships or conclusions drawn from altmetrics are fraught with
problems of generalizability. Unlike citations, which are drawn from
curated databases with known properties, altmetrics’ reliance on the Web
means that the metrics must be disentangled from the underlying usage
patterns of the Web’s chaotic social services. This is particularly
problematic given the “staggering amount of unevenness in the production
and dissemination of information [on the Web]” (Graham et al., 2011, p.
26).1
This unevenness must be taken into account in the search for a
generalized understanding of what altmetrics mean and what they can
offer. There are on-going efforts, such as the NISO Altmetrics Project
(NISO, 2014), that aim to standardize the metrics, but these efforts must
necessarily be informed by studies that look at altmetrics in journals and
articles published and read in a broad range of contexts, including research
that is published and read in regions of the world beyond the global
North2
, as well as in other languages beyond English. Only by studying
 1. There is a parallel here to the underrepresentation of some parts of the world in
commercial citation databases that many, including myself, have previously criticized
(Alperin 2014a, 2014b; Cetto and Alonso-Gamboa,1998; Graham et al., 2011). However,
in the case of citation databases, there is at least a known and recognized selection bias.
In contrast, the Internet is often seen as a democratizing force, where everyone
participates equality. The work of Oxford Internet Institute’s Information Geographies
project shows that, in practice, this is not the case (Graham et al., 2011, 2014).
2. The terms “Global North/South” are preferred here because they do not have the
judgemental connotation of other related terms such as “Developed/Developing World”
or “First/Third World”. The Global North describes the group of countries that are in a
privileged economic and political position, such as Canada, the United States, Western
Europe, and parts of East Asia.

altmetrics in a diverse set of contexts (e.g., by geography, language,
content) will it be possible to understand the limits and potential of what
altmetrics can measure.
Given the relative recency of altmetrics, further work is still needed in
all contexts. This study seeks to contribute to the literature of the
altmetrics community by being the first to explore the coverage levels
between countries, subjects, and languages of articles published from
Latin America. In doing so, it focuses special attention to the region’s
largest country: Brazil. By exploring a developing region broadly and an
emerging country in detail, this research hopes to open a window on the
universality and limits of some of the existing claims from the altmetrics
literature, and through that window, provide a clearer understanding of the
differences in the potential of altmetrics around the world.
Background
Altmetrics work by looking for references to scholarly works on the Web,
including “traditional” social media (i.e., Twitter, Facebook, Google+),
blogs (i.e., researchblogging.com, ScienceSeeker, Wordpress.com),
academic bookmarking services and reference managers (i.e., CiteULike,
Mendeley, Connotea), media outlets (i.e., New York Times, The
Economist, Wired ), and multimedia (i.e., Youtube, podcasts), postpublication
peer review sites (i.e., F1000 Prime), and a handful of others.
However, there is no official list of what constitutes an alternative metric.
Virtually any metric that can be collected over the Web, and that is not a
citation, can be considered an alternative metric. One of the most
complicated aspects of altmetrics is that each of these sources has a
different degree of adoption and use around the world and between
different online communities. An understanding of this difference in use
must necessarily influence the metrics that can be derived from each
source.
Even in the face of disparate use across contexts, altmetrics warrant
attention, not least because of the growing importance of the role of the
Web in the communication of science. For example, it is thought that
Twitter use among scholars has been growing (Priem et al., 2012), and
several surveys confirm that most scholars are making at least some use of
“Web 2.0” tools (Procter et al., 2010, Tenopir et al., 2013).3 More
generally, the number of articles that are shared or discussed each day is
increasing at an estimated rate of between 5–10% per month (Adie and
Roe, 2013). So while the presence of articles in social media is still
relatively low—at an estimated 15–24% (Costas et al., in press)—the
 3. Unsurprisingly, younger scholars seem to use social media more often (Tenopir et al.,
2013). However, contrary to expectations, the respondents that report most social media
use were also the ones who reported reading the most scholarly papers (Tenopir et al.,
2013).

potential of these metrics increases daily, and with them the need to
understand altmetrics across a wide range of contexts.
Even as there is more scrutiny on mentions of articles on the social
Web and as coverage levels are better understood, it is still unclear to what
degree altmetrics can be used for capturing different forms of impact.
There is a definite sense that the numbers in some way indicate attention,
influence, or even impact, but it is still unknown how. As a consequence,
most of the existing altmetric studies so far have focused on the
relationship between altmetrics and citation metrics. So far, the strongest
correlation between any altmetrics source and citations were found for
F1000 Prime recommendations (Li and Thelwall, 2012). However, several
studies have shown a moderate level of correlation between saves in the
bibliographic manager Mendeley and citations (Li et al., 2012; Priem et
al., 2012; Bar-Ilan, 2012; Bar-Ilan et al., 2012). Mentions in blogs has also
shown to have a positive correlation with citations (Fausto et al., 2012;
Costas et al., in press), although this appears to be heavily influenced by
the makeup of bloggers themselves and the journals they tend to blog
about, both of which introduce a strong bias for high-impact life science
journals (Shema et al., 2012). Twitter, the most prevalent of the social
media altmetrics sources (Thelwall et al., 2013), was found to have a low
(but positive) correlation to citations (Haustein et al., 2014c; Eysenbach,
2011). Eysenbach (2011) additionally found that, for a small sample of
articles from a single journal, highly tweeted papers could also be used as
early predictors of citations, something supported by the findings of
(Shuai et al., 2012; Thelwall et al., 2013). In short, there appears to be a
low to moderate correlation between some altmetric sources and citations,
at least in the specific journals and disciplines studied (primarily wellknown
English-language natural and life science journals).4
While the presence of scholarly articles in online channels of
communication is growing, most research on altmetrics conclude with a
call for further study of the reliability, validity, and context of the
available metrics (Haustein et al., 2014c; Wouters and Costas, 2012; Liu
and Adie, 2013). The existing studies have primarily used well-established
journals such as Science and Nature (Li et al., 2012), and JASIST (BarIlan,
2014) or large archives such as arXiv.org and PubMed (Shuai et al.,
2013; Haustein et al., 2014a, 2014c), or in the broadest of cases, samples
drawn from bibliographic databases like the Web of Science (WoS)
(Zahedi et al., 2014a).5 This limited array of sources introduces a selection

and provide some details on sample sizes and correlation coefficients which are omitted

be a comprehensive list. A more complete list of works can be found by looking at the

bias that calls into question the generalizability of reported results. The
appeal of these sources is obvious—they are prominent and their data is
easily available for analysis—but there is a need to turn to a different
geographic, economic, and socio-cultural context in order to understand
the universality of claims about altmetrics. Latin America’s leading
research publishing initiatives provide such an alternative context. This
study therefore presents an exploration of the penetration of altmetrics by
looking at a large Latin American scholarly journal portal.
There are many scholarly publishing initiatives in Latin America.
They range from small and institutional, to large and regional; from broad
multidisciplinary to subject specific; from those focused on scholarly
journals, to those focused on institutional archiving; and they can be found
in virtually every country between Mexico and Argentina. The number of
initiatives continues to grow, but the three major initiatives—Latindex,
RedALyC, and SciELO—are arguably the most influential and certainly
provide the best available data on the scholarly publishing activities of the
region (Alperin, 2014a).
Data & Methods
This study focuses on SciELO for access to both articles and journal
metadata. SciELO publishes and indexes full-text articles of over 1,200
journals and over 500,000 full-text articles across 12 national collections
from Iberomaerica and the Caribbean.[6] While SciELO is technically a
publisher (that is, it publishes” content online which in some cases has not
been made available elsewhere), it is not a publisher in the traditional
sense (i.e., it is not involved in the operation of the journals, nor does it
provide financing, editing, or other oversight of the editorial or production
process). It has been described as a both a “meta-publisher” (Packer and
Meneghini, 2007) and as a hybrid between a repository and a publisher
(Guédon, 2008).
SciELO is widely recognized in the region (Gomez et al., 2013) and
has gained acceptance as a marker of quality by several national science
councils (Alperin et al., 2011) because it hosts some of the best-regarded
journals published from within Latin America. This study focuses on
journals from the nine national collections from Latin America and the
Caribbean, namely Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba,
Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela.[7] These collections differ greatly in size,
with the flagship collection (Brazil), publishing over four times as many
articles as the next largest collection (Chile) (Table 1). Not only does
SciELO provide access to full-text articles through their Web portal, it
 good overview of the types of studies, and the sources and locations used by the
altmetrics community.

also provides curated metadata (bibliographic information), download
data, and citation data for the articles they publish.
Article-level data from SciELO was collected through available
application programming interfaces (APIs) for the years starting in 2000.8
The data was last updated in May 2014, and includes articles that were
available by that date, for a total of 389,795 articles from the Latin
American portals, with Brazil making up 58% of those articles. The
corpus covers a wide range of subject fields in varying degrees (Table 2).
It is difficult to compare coverage levels across subjects because, like in
the WoS, journals can be categorized in more than one field
simultaneously, but unlike WoS, SciELO does not provide a single toplevel
categorization. SciELO’s origins in the Health Sciences is evident
from the fact that over 40% of the articles are classified in that category.
The next most prevalent categories are the Humanities with 20%, followed
by Agricultural Sciences, Applied Social Sciences, and Biological
Sciences each around 12–15%.9
While detailed metadata, download statistics, and citation data for the
articles were downloaded from SciELO, most of the altmetric data was
provided by the largest of altmetric providers, Altmetric.com, including
the number of mentions in social media (i.e., Twitter, Facebook,
Google+), videos (i.e., youtube.com), and mainstream media (i.e.,
NYTimes, Slate).10 The data were provided in June 2014 and comprise all
mentions of any URLs within the SciELO domains (i.e., containing
“scielo” in the domain name) in the collected altmetrics sources. For most
SciELO collections, the Altmetric.com data goes back to November 2013,

but in the case of SciELO Brazil (scielo.br) an extended set goes back to
January 2013.11
The article data from SciELO was linked with the Altmetric.com data
by matching on the internal SciELO article ID. The article ID was
immediately available in the SciELO dataset, and was extracted from the
Altmetric.com dataset by looking at the URLs mentioned in every record.
The SciELO ID can be seen in the article’s URL in the form of a URL
parameter, making mentions of SciELO articles (and their corresponding
ID) unambiguously identifiable. This process lead to the identification of
8,427 total mentions (in any source) across 3,647 SciELO articles (in any
collection). For the extended Altmetric.com dataset corresponding to only
scielo.br articles from 2013, the data was linked to the scielo.br data using
a DOI available in both datasets, yielding a total of 3,588 mentions across
1,686 articles.
In addition, a series of Python scripts (written by the author) were
used to query the number of times articles are mentioned in the English,
Spanish, and Portuguese editions of Wikipedia and saved in the Mendeley
reference manager. Data from Mendeley was fetched by searching the
Mendeley API with the article title, and verifying the search results using
the year of publication and the first author last name.12 Similarly,
Wikipedia counts were fetched by searching the Wikipedia API for
mentions of a partial URLs, which were specific enough to uniquely
identify mentions of SciELO articles, but general enough to catch all URL
variants of an article.13 Both scripts were run in September 2014. The
same method described for the Altmetric.com data was used to extract and
link the SciELO ID from the URLs identified on Wikipedia.
 11. All analyses that compare Altmetric.com across national collections use only
mentions after November 2013. The analyses specific to SciELO Brazil uses the
expanded set starting in January 2013.

The resulting dataset contains every SciELO article published in Latin
America between January 2000 and May 2014 linked using the SciELO
ID to every mention in the Altmetric.com dataset that occurred since
November 2013. The dataset also includes any mention of those articles in
Mendeley and in English, Spanish, and Portuguese versions of Wikipedia
as of September 2014.
Results
With the data in place, it is possible to measure coverage across the entire
corpus, between country, disciplines, and language in two ways: 1) by
looking at the total number of social media mentions, and 2) by looking at
the proportion of articles that receive mentions. The raw counts give a
sense of the scale of activity surrounding the articles (i.e., how many
people are engaging with these articles on social media) and the
percentage coverage indicates how concentrated or spread out the activity
is across all articles (i.e., how many articles solicit engagement).
The first thing to note is that across the SciELO collections, the
source with the most mentions (by several orders of magnitude) is
Mendeley, with Twitter being a distant second, and Facebook third (Table
3). Other sources have negligible coverage or none at all.[14] The total of
all mentions in the dataset is 1,189,583, of which Mendeley makes up
almost 80% and Twitter just over 8%.[15] These mentions are associated
with 173,733 articles (Table 4).
As can be seen in the tables below, the Brazilian journals on SciELO
have far larger number of mentions than any other country’s journals. It is
worth repeating that for all sources except Mendeley and Wikipedia,
numbers are based only on mentions that occurred between November 1st
2013 and May 31st, 2014, a period that typically sees lower overall use
because it spans the Christmas and the summer holidays in the Southern
hemisphere, as well as Carnival in Brazil. When Mendeley is excluded
from the analysis, the number of mentions drops drastically to only 9,372
mentions spanning 4,399 articles (just over 1% of all articles).
The immediacy and obsolescence of most altmetrics has still been
relatively understudied, but there are clear signs that, like with citationsbased
metrics, time since publication is an important measure. In several
multi-year studies, most altmetrics show an increasing presence in more
recent publications (Costas et al., in press; Zahedi et al., 2014a; Haustein
et al., 2014b), although Zahedi et al. (2014a) show that when looked at as
a percentage of all articles published, some sources (such as Mendeley)
tend to peak a few years prior to the current year (likely indicative of a

multi-year obsolescence period), whereas other sources (such as Twitter)
have higher coverage as a percentage of all articles for the most recent
years (likely indicative of increasing adoption coupled with a shorter
obsolescence period).
SciELO articles do not deviate from this pattern. Articles display the
expected pattern of higher mentions for more recent publications, with
Mendeley having higher coverage as a percentage of all articles a few
years prior (peak in 2007/2008), although 2012 already shows twice the
coverage levels of 2013. The apparent short obsolescence period for most
of the metrics studied suggests that for a more meaningful analysis across
multiple metrics it would be more fruitful to focus on metrics that were
collected closer to the publication date. The extended set of Altmetric.com
data that includes SciELO Brazil (scielo.br) data dating back to January
2013 suits this purpose (all other characteristics of the data remain the
same). However, the significantly higher coverage of Mendeley for
previous years (up to three times that of 2013) suggests that it may be
worthwhile to study Mendeley on its own.
The number of scielo.br articles from 2013 with social media metrics
is significantly higher than for any other country in that year, although the
numbers are quite low even here. Across sources, 5,319 (25.09%) of
articles had at least one metric, but if Mendeley is excluded, only 1,701
(8.02%) have at least one metric. For all of 2013, several of the categories
did not have any mentions (LinkedIn, Reddit, Pinterest, q&a, peer review).
Other categories also had less than 0.01% coverage (< 25 articles) (news,
blogs, Google+, F1000, video, and Wikipedia). The only three sources
with any significant number of mentions were Mendeley, Twitter, and
Facebook.
Table 6 summarizes the levels of coverage for these three main
metrics at the article level. There were 3,986 (18.80%) articles with at
least one Mendeley reader, 1,286 (6.03%) with at least one Tweet, and 596
(2.81%) articles with a Facebook public wall post. As discussed later,
these levels of coverage are lower than what has been reported by other
studies.
The levels of coverage vary by journal, with a handful of journals
exhibiting nearly universal coverage. On average, 15.3% of a journal’s
articles had at least one Mendeley reader (std. dev. 20.0), 5.8% of
journal’s articles had at least one tweet (std. dev. 9.3), and 3.14% of a
journal’s articles had at least one Facebook post (std. dev. 4.5). The spread
of coverage can be seen in Figure 1. In all three cases, there are numerous
journals that extend well beyond the 75% percentile, potentially indicative
of a marked difference in user communities or potentially a different
promotion and diffusion strategies employed by the journals.
The relationship between coverage and number of mentions in all
three sources can be viewed by plotting the coverage levels against the
mean number of mentions, which reveals a fairly strong correlation

between the level of coverage a journal receives (y-axes) and the mean
number of saves/mentions received by the articles in that journal (x-axes).
This correlation is confirmed through an ordinary least-squares regression
that results in R2 of 0.69 for Mendeley, 0.77 for Twitter, and 0.82 for
Facebook (Figure 2). This is perhaps unsurprising given that the mean
number of mentions is so low in most cases, so each mention is likely the
first for the article, simultaneously increasing the journal’s coverage and
mean number by one.
Unfortunately, the citation window in the scielo.br dataset is too small
to make comparisons to citations meaningful (there has not been sufficient
time for citations to accumulate given that the Altmetric.com data is only
available for articles published since 2013). In the absence of meaningful
citation data, the top altmetrics were compared with the download counts
of the full-text in the first 30 and 90 days after publication.

Mendeley, Tweets, Facebook, and number of full text downloads in
the first 30 and 90 days since publication were all correlated using
Spearman’s rank correlation (Table 7). Twitter was the most highly
correlated of the altmetrics, with coefficients around .2 with both the
download metrics and with Facebook. No correlation was found between
Twitter and Mendeley. The Spearman coefficients for Facebook were a
little lower (around 0.15 with downloads in first 30 and 90 days) and, as
already noted, .2 with Twitter. Again, no correlation was found between
posts Facebook and Mendeley readers. Mendeley showed the lowest
correlations across the board, with correlations of around .1 with
downloads. The correlations, where they exist, are positive but low,
similar to the effects found when comparing Tweets to citations (Haustein

et al., 2014c). As can be expected from these low correlations, there is
little overlap in the sets of articles that receive Tweets, Facebook posts,
and Mendeley saves (Figure 3).
Not only are the articles themselves different, but they are also
comprised of different sets of languages, with coverage fluctuating
depending on the language of the content. Content in English is about
three times as likely to be saved in Mendeley than content in Spanish or
Portuguese (29.0% of English content has Mendeley readers, versus 11.2
and 9.6% of Spanish and Portuguese respectively). Content in Portuguese,
however, is almost four times as likely to be shared on Facebook than
content in Spanish, and almost twice as likely as content in English (3.8%
for Portuguese versus 1.0% for Spanish and 1.7% for English). It should
be noted that, given that this data are drawn from the Brazilian journals in
SciELO, the sample of Spanish articles is quite low (N=412 articles),
compared to the dominant Portuguese (N=11,909) and popular English
(N=8,850).
Figure 4 shows the coverage of these three sources is on articles of
different disciplines. The Humanities Sciences, for example, have among
the lowest Mendeley coverage, but the highest Facebook coverage and
second highest Twitter coverage. The converse is true of the Biological
Sciences, which have the highest levels of Mendeley coverage but
amongst the lowest Facebook coverage. Engineering, on the other hand,
has very low coverage on social media, but moderate coverage in
Mendeley. The Health Sciences seem to be the only field that is high
across all three measures, with the highest or second highest coverage for
each. These between-field fluctuations in coverage levels are indicative of
differing uses of social media, potentially indicating different audiences
are being reached by each discipline or different practices regarding social
media and reference management.
Discussion and Conclusions
The differences uncovered by this study point to the need of careful
sample selection when making generalizable claims about altmetrics. In
particular, it draws attention to the importance of considering and further
studying altmetrics in developing and emerging country contexts.
The levels of coverage by the major altmetrics sources are generally
lower than what has been previously reported. Most sources showed zero
or almost zero coverage for all of the SciELO collection. Large differences
were also found between the metrics that showed some coverage
(Mendeley, Twitter, and Facebook).

FIGURE 4. Mendeley, Twitter and Facebook coverage by subject
Of these, the most dramatic differences were found for Twitter, for
which Haustein et al. (2014c) found that over 20% of articles from 2012
were tweeted at least once (twice that of 2011) using a set of articles in
both PubMed and WoS. Other Twitter studies have found that 39% of
arXiv papers (2012) are tweeted at least once (Haustein et al., 2014) and
over 11% in an older study of 2010 PLOS One articles (Priem et al.,
2012). Again, the study showing the lowest coverage was Zahedi et
al.(2014a), who found only 4% of 2011 papers had Tweets (a doubling
from 2010 and a quadrupling from 2009). However, the trend identified by
both Haustein et al. (2014c) and Zahedi et al., (2014a) suggests that by
2013 similar samples would have even higher coverage in 2013, in both
cases eclipsing the 6% found for the 2013 articles from scielo.br.
For Mendeley, the differences are especially pronounced for the most
recent year. The lowest reported coverage in Mendeley (for articles in the
most recent year) was 57% (Zahedi et al., 2014a) followed closely by
another at 61% (Hammarfelt, 2014). The first of these studies is derived
from a random sample chosen from the WoS (from 2011) and the second
from a small sample of articles from a Swedish University. For studies

that include Mendeley, 60% is in itself a low figure given that most studies
report values of over 80% (and some as high as 95%) (Li and Thelwall,
2012; Priem et al., 2012; Bar-Ilan, 2014; Zahedi et al., 2014b). These
levels of coverage dwarf the 19% found for scielo.br in 2013, although
they are closer to the coverage levels when looking at articles from more
than two years prior. The reported values suggest that SciELO Mendeley
coverage may approach that found elsewhere, although there appears to be
a longer lag in articles being saved into the reference manager (of
approximately two years).
The gap between the Facebook coverage of scielo.br and that of
previous studies is not as clear. While Priem et al., (2012) found a quarter
of 2010 PLOS One articles to be shared on Facebook, as few as 2.8% of
the 2013 scielo.br articles were mentioned on the platform. This appears to
be a significant different, but a direct comparison is hampered by
Altmetric.com’s method of querying Facebook, which captures only
public posts wheras the method used by Priem et al., (2012) captures all
posts. As a result, Altmetric’s method misses a potentially large segment
of all links shared on Facebook. The 2.8% of SciELO articles found on
Facebook is consistent with the coverage levels found by Hammarfelt
(2014) using Altmetric’s data for the small Swedish University sample.
Overall, the difference in the Latin American collections, even in the
Brazilian case, indicate that altmetrics show different patterns of coverage
than in previously studied contexts (generally lower), especially for the
two most prevalent sources (Mendeley and Twitter). Even when compared
to the overall coverage of altmetrics measured in previous studies,
coverage that includes older articles (which have lower metrics), the
contemporary Latin American coverage remains lower. There are at least
three plausible explanations for this lower coverage: 1) the articles
published in SciELO simply have lower usage overall, and this is reflected
in lower social media usage; 2) the levels of social media usage, at least
among academics, is lower in Latin America than in the previously studied
contexts; or 3) there is a different culture surrounding the sharing of
research on social media among the readers of Latin American research.
Each of these possible explanations warrants further investigation.
The situation is changing rapidly and will need continuous
monitoring. The sharing of research articles on social media appears to be
highly variable, making the analysis of trends over time necessary for
making sense of what altmetrics have to offer. Furthermore, the evidence
presented here suggests that studies of altmetrics cannot be done without
the contextualization of the research and social media landscape in which
they are embedded. The explanations offered above point to the need of
looking at the levels of use of the research, the adoption of social media,
and the cultural practices that make up academic work—all of which vary
by geography, but also any number of other dimensions, such as discipline
and language.

Looking beyond the well-established, high-impact, natural and life
science journals is an acknowledgement that “user-generated content [such
as what is used for altmetrics] is far from being a simple mirror of either
population density or human activity” (Graham et al., 2011, p. 26).
Examining the prevalence of altmetrics in different contexts will lead to a
better understanding of the significance of the metrics overall, and, at the
same time, it will serve to ensure that the eventual use of altmetrics takes
into consideration these differences.
